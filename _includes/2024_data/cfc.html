          <h2> Submission Guidelines</h2>
          <p>
            You are invited to submit regular papers of up to ten pages, or four pages for works-in-progress, including references. To be considered, papers must be received by the submission deadline. Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. Please mark all of your conflicts of interest when submitting your paper. Papers should be in IEEE conference format. Templates can be found at https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html.
            <h2> Presentation Form </h2>
            All accepted submissions will be presented at the conference and included in the IEEE conference proceedings. Due to time constraints, accepted papers will be selected for presentation as either talk or poster based on their review score and novelty. Nonetheless, all accepted papers should be considered as having equal importance.
            One author of each accepted paper is required to attend the conference and present the paper for it to be included in the proceedings.
